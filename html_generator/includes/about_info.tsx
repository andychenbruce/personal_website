      <p>
        Welcome to my website. I am majoring in computer science at <a href="https://ucsc.edu">UCSC</a> in Santa Cruz, California. This website has many projects that I have worked on in the past few years. My interests include programming, electronics, robotics, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, 3D-graphics, physical simulations, and sustainable agriculture. If you want to hire for machine learning, software engineering, or embedded programming, please look at <a href="/Andy-Bruce-Resume.pdf">my resume</a>.
